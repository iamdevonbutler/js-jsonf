test what happens when given async generator or other erroneous shit.

use terminology encode and decode rather than reconstruct deconstruct?
cant we just toString functions?

update naming a - l

/**
  * Map
  * b string
  * c false
  * d true
  * e NaN
  * f number
  * g array
  * h null
  * i undefined
  * j object
  * k date
  * l function
 */

is there a way to run a transform test locally. so like before we encode and push remote,
what if we did it locally, parsed it, and compared it to orig.

see if we can inc perf.

array as root testing for tests and perf.
