# jsonf

A malformed JSON parser w/ function support

---

## Supported data types

- String
- Boolean
- Number
- Array
- Object
- Date
- Function
- NaN
- null
- undefined

## Caveats

Function behavior is normalized and consistent; however, the parsed function may contain formatting differences from the original; its functionality however, will remain consistent.
